## Introduction
The following help setup Raspbian more efficently, e.g. headless and remote config.


## Enabling Wifi and SSH on first boot
To have Raspbian started with Wifi create a file wpa_supplicant.conf in the /boot partition with the following contents:
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=GB

network={
        ssid="your_ssid"
        psk="your_psk"
        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```
To also enable SSH, touch a file ssh in the same /boot location

## Enable x2go for remote desktop
```sudo apt-get install x2goserver```

Download [x2go client](https://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/download:start)
Setup custom desktop as /usr/bin/startlxde-pi
